      - description: "It is not an easy task as there are millions of songs on music streaming services such as Spotify and it is possible to recommend the user songs that they might appreciate. The presented project will be devoted to the creation of a recommendation system on the basis of the data of about 1921-2020 Spotify lists. It has more than 160,000 songs, and the data includes the title of the song as well as the artist or the year of release, tempo, danceability, energy, and popularity. The system will utilize a variety of techniques: Collaborative Filtering: Based on user-item interactions (such as previous song plays, ratings, or likes).
                Content-Based Filtering: Recommending songs with similar attributes (e.g., genre, tempo, danceability).
                Hybrid Models: Combining both collaborative and content-based methods for more accurate recommendations."

A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.
1. The dataset offers a diverse mix of numerical audio‐features (continuous) and categorical/metadata features, allowing you to apply a wide range of techniques
2. Adequate size for scalable analytics with 160 K rows



Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

## Questions
What key audio and metadata features (such as danceability, energy, tempo, or valence) most strongly influence a song’s popularity on Spotify?
This question focuses on identifying predictive attributes that determine song success, enabling classification or regression modeling to forecast popularity.

How have the musical characteristics of popular songs evolved across different decades (1920s–2020s)?
This question explores temporal trends to reveal how listener preferences and musical production styles have changed over time using clustering and trend analysis.

## Analysis plan

- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.

Feature Engineering: Derive key audio features (tempo, danceability, energy, popularity) and encode categorical variables (artist, genre, style).

Collaborative Filtering: Apply SVD or KNN to predict user preferences based on similar listener profiles.

Content-Based Filtering: Recommend songs with similar musical characteristics to those a user already enjoys.

Hybrid Model: Combine collaborative and content-based methods using Matrix Factorization or Neural Network approaches.

Evaluation (Precision/Recall/F1): Measure accuracy and relevance of recommendations.

Evaluation (MSE): Assess numerical prediction error in rating or popularity estimation.

Evaluation (Top-N Accuracy): Evaluate how often recommended tracks appear in the user’s top selections.
