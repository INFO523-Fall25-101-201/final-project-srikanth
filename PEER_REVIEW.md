This is a duplicate comment. I may have added a comment in the wrong place on 10/05/2025. 

The following are my recommended items to consider.

It looks like your GitHub Pages deployment is failing, so I wasn't able to see the fully rendered proposal.qmd on the website. You might want to check the "Actions" tab in your repo for the source.

I also looked at the Kaggle dataset you're planning to use. It seems like a good fit for analyzing song features (such as danceability and energy), but it doesn't appear to include user-item interaction data (i.e., which users listened to which songs). I believe that to create a personalized recommendation engine, you would also need data on users' listening habits.

If I’m incorrect about anything, I would appreciate your feedback via GitHub or Slack since I’m also new to this type of project.
Thank you!
